# sid v2 — stronger educational Git-like VCS

This is a more featureful educational implementation of a Git-like VCS named `sid`.
It includes:
- init, clone, config, add, status, diff, commit, reset, rm
- branch, checkout, merge, branch delete (-d/-D)
- stash, stash pop, stash list
- remote add/list, fetch, push, pull (local filesystem `file:///` remote supported)
- log, reflog (basic), tag-like refs are under refs/tags
- pyproject.toml for packaging

This is intended as an educational project. It does **not** implement the full Git protocol
and is not safe for production use.
